### From Banking to Artificial Intelligence.
Currently pursuing a **Master of Science specializing in AI at Epitech** (France), I combine my past financial expertise with my new skills in Data Science and Machine Learning.

### 🚀 What I'm Currently Building

Most of my projects are SaaS solutions currently in development (private repos), but my main focus is **FinTech**.

**🧠 Flagship Project: Autonomous Trading Agent**
I am developing a decision-making architecture based on **Ensemble Learning** to mitigate false signals. The model relies on three simultaneous analysis pillars:

*  **Tabular AI:** Quantitative analysis of raw market data.
*  **Computer Vision (CNN):** Technical analysis and chart pattern detection using Convolutional Neural Networks.
*  **Macroeconomics:** Integration of exogenous variables for global context.

### 🎯 My Philosophy
> *"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."*

I value:
* **Clarity:** Readable and documented code, even for complex models.
* **Efficiency:** Focusing on essentials without over-engineering (KISS).
* **Business Value:** I don't just code for the sake of coding; I solve real financial problems.

### 📚 Currently Exploring
I'm currently deep-diving into these topics to enhance my AI models:
*  **Reinforcement Learning (PPO/DQN)** for portfolio optimization.
*  **Model Quantization** to optimize inference speed in SaaS environments.
*  **Microservices Architecture** for scalable trading backends.
